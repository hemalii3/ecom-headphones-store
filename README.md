Developed and deployed a responsive eCommerce website using Next.js, Sanity CMS, and Stripe, enabling product listing, dynamic pages, and secure checkout functionality.

Integrated Sanity as a headless CMS for real-time content management and dynamic routing with getStaticProps and getServerSideProps.

Deployed the static site to Netlify using next export, optimizing performance with static generation (SSG) and delivering a fully client-side experience.
